# Git Fork Workflow

Expert guidance for managing forked repositories, synchronizing with upstream, and contributing back cleanly.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use git-upstream-pr instead when... |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Understanding fork remote architecture | Ready to submit a PR to upstream |
| Diagnosing fork divergence from upstream | Need step-by-step PR creation workflow |
| Syncing fork's main with upstream | Cherry-picking specific commits for upstream |
| Deciding on a sync strategy | Creating a cross-fork PR via `gh` CLI |

## Remote Architecture

Forks use two remotes:

| Remote | Points To | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `origin` | Your fork (`you/repo`) | Push your work here |
| `upstream` | Original repo (`owner/repo`) | Pull updates from here |

### Setup

```bash
# Verify remotes
git remote -v

# Add upstream if missing
git remote add upstream git@github.com:owner/original-repo.git

# Verify
git fetch upstream
git remote -v
```

### Identifying Fork vs Upstream

```bash
# Check if upstream remote exists
git remote get-url upstream

# Get fork owner
git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#.*github\.com[:/]##; s#\.git$##'

# Get upstream owner
git remote get-url upstream | sed -E 's#.*github\.com[:/]##; s#\.git$##'
```

## The Divergence Problem

When you squash-merge branches into your fork's main, the commit SHAs differ from upstream's commits. This creates divergence even when the code content is identical.

### Detecting Divergence

```bash
# Fetch latest from both remotes
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream

# Count ahead/behind
git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...origin/main

# Show divergent commits
git log --oneline upstream/main..origin/main   # Commits on fork not on upstream
git log --oneline origin/main..upstream/main   # Commits on upstream not on fork
```

### Reading the Output

`git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...origin/main` returns two numbers:

| Output | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `0  0` | Perfectly in sync |
| `5  0` | Fork is 5 behind upstream (upstream has 5 new commits) |
| `0  3` | Fork is 3 ahead (fork has 3 commits not on upstream) |
| `5  3` | Diverged: upstream has 5 new, fork has 3 unique |

## Sync Strategies

### Strategy 1: GitHub CLI Sync (Simplest)

```bash
# Syncs fork's default branch with upstream via GitHub API
gh repo sync owner/fork-repo

# Then pull locally
git pull origin main
```

Best when: fork has no unique commits worth preserving on main.

### Strategy 2: Fast-Forward Merge (Clean Canary)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
```

Best when: fork's main has not diverged. Fails cleanly if diverged (no messy merge commits).

### Strategy 3: Hard Reset (Force Sync)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

Best when: fork's main has diverged and you want to discard fork-only commits. **Destructive** - ensure no unique work is on main.

### Strategy 4: Rebase (Preserve Fork Work)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

Best when: fork has unique commits on main that should sit on top of upstream's history.

### Strategy Selection

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Fork main is clean, no unique commits | Fast-forward or `gh repo sync` |
| Fork main diverged, unique work expendable | Hard reset |
| Fork main diverged, unique work worth keeping | Rebase |
| Just want to match upstream exactly | Hard reset |
| Not sure | Try fast-forward first; it fails safely if diverged |

## Golden Rule for Upstream PRs

**Branch from `upstream/main`, not from your fork's main.** This completely bypasses fork divergence:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch -c feat/my-contribution upstream/main
# Cherry-pick, code, or apply changes here
git push -u origin feat/my-contribution
# Create cross-fork PR targeting upstream
```

See [git-upstream-pr](../git-upstream-pr/SKILL.md) for the complete workflow.

## Cross-Fork PR Syntax

```bash
# Create PR from fork branch to upstream repo
gh pr create \
  --repo owner/upstream-repo \
  --base main \
  --head your-username:feat/branch-name \
  --title "feat: description" \
  --body "PR description"
```

The `--head` must include the fork owner prefix (`your-username:branch`) when targeting a different repository.

## Common Patterns

### Check if Working in a Fork

```bash
# Has upstream remote = likely a fork
git remote get-url upstream 2>/dev/null && echo "Fork" || echo "Not a fork"
```

### Periodic Sync Workflow

```bash
# Weekly sync routine
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge --ff-only upstream/main || echo "Diverged - manual sync needed"
git push origin main
```

### View Upstream Changes Since Last Sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline origin/main..upstream/main
```

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Divergence count | `git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...origin/main` |
| Fork ahead commits | `git log --oneline --format='%h %s' upstream/main..origin/main` |
| Fork behind commits | `git log --oneline --format='%h %s' origin/main..upstream/main` |
| Quick sync check | `git fetch upstream && git merge --ff-only upstream/main` |
| Remote listing | `git remote -v` |
